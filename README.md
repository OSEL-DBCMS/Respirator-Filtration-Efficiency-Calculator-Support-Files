# SEM-Images-for-PPE-Calculator
Here is a collection of SEM images taken of five different PPE respiratory models and four different surgical gowns.

The images are in their respective folder with each main folder following the organizational structure below:

PPE type -> Cross sections and experimental conditions -> PPE product -> Individual samples -> Sample location -> SEM images and HDR metadata

These images were used in the development of the PPE Calculator and characterization of PPE material used for gowns and respirators.

Image File Format: 
The images in this file are structured the same and adjusted to reflect key variables—the variables include the following:  
1.)	The N95 respirator model
2.)	Treatment groups (i.e. ozone exposure or vaporized hydrogen peroxide or controls (no exposure)
3.)	The respirator technical replicate # in the treatment group
4.)	The position on that technical replicate (Top, Middle, Bottom (see figure 1))
5.)	The layer being imaged (inner, middle, outer (see figure 1))*
*Some layers images will have replicate number next to them (1, 2, etc.). These images are of the same location taken at different magnification. It is up to the user to decide which magnification works best for their purposes.
6.)	Calendar days/dates images were captured.
An example file name following this format would be as follows: 
“R2_untreated_m1_bot_IL_05232023”
