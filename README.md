# SEM-Images-for-PPE-Calculator
Here is a collection of SEM images taken of five different PPE respiratory models and four different surgical gowns.

The images are in their respective folder with each main folder following the organizational structure below:

PPE type -> Cross sections and experimental conditions -> PPE product -> Individual samples -> Sample location -> SEM images and HDR metadata

These images were used in the development of the PPE Calculator and characterization of PPE material used for gowns and respirators.
